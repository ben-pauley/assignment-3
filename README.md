## My Repository
In this GitHub repository, you will find my completed assignment for week 4 of the programme. My task was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they selected. The application runs in a browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The focus of this assignment, however, was to power the password generator with JavaScript. I believe I was successful in meeting the criteria given.

## Installation

Nothing is required to install my project, but the project is deployed live at this URL: https://ben-pauley.github.io/assignment-3/.

## Software Used

This project was completed using Visual Studio Code and I tested the website using Google Chrome. The assignment was largely completed using JavaScript functions

## Conclusion

I very much enjoyed the task of completing this assignment, in spite of how challenging it was. What I found most challenging was splitting my code into smaller functions, though I believe I was quite successful in doing so.
